Hello my name is Jose Gonzalez Chavira and this is my IT Profesional Toolkit for the class IT Strategy, Policy & Governance on the progream [M.S in Information Technology](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/it/programs/msit.php) in Kennesaw State University 


### IT Strategy

There are numerous instruments accessible to help in the production of an **IT Strategy plan**. Subsequent to doing some online research there have numerous asset and modules to enable us to make a system plan. A portion of the instruments/modules include: 

-	Vital IT Planning Workbook 
-	Intuitive Online Tool (need to make a record to utilize this device) 
-	Procedure Flowcharts 
-	Contextual analyses 

I investigated these assets and I discovered them extremely accommodating and useful so as to make an IT Strategy plan. If I somehow happened to make my own, I would check and pursue their modules. 

### IT Policy

Present day association are embracing new apparatuses to make their **IT Policy**. In the wake of leading on the web explore I went over a this Garner report [Link](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2018/) has some economical fact that cutting-edge association are utilizing to make their IT strategies.

What grabbed my attention is that a portion of the instruments and programming they referenced in the article I use them as of now (for example Grammarly, Evernote, and so on.). They additionally have devices that will help an association in the production of work processes, mind-mapping or conceptualizing, arranging contemplations, strategy composing instruments, language simplifiers, and some more.

Subsequent to doing on the web explore I found out about the fruitful formation of **IT Governance**. I didn't have an inkling how essential is the job of the IT administration in the general making of an IT engineering. 

They have a few instruments accessible in their site that appear to be useful. They accentuate in a decent production of IT scene, adjusting frameworks to business objectives, and setting up the establishment of an IT change.
